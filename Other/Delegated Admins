Delegated Groups: (Security -> Delegated Administration)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Use delegated administration to assign limited admin privileges to users in your org who aren’t administrators. 

EX: You want the Customer Support team manager to manage users in the Support Manager role and all subordinate roles. Create a delegated admin for this purpose so that you can focus on other administration tasks

The primary functions of a delegated administrator include:
	-creating and editing users
	-resetting passwords for users
	-unlocking users
	-assigning users to specified profiles
	-logging in as a user who has granted login access to the administrator.
	-managing custom objects created by an administrator
	-setting quotas, creating default opportunity teams, and creating personal groups for those users
