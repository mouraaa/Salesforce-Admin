Processes (also known as paths)
——————————————————————————————————————————
A process is the sequential graph at the top of the record that shows what phase the object is in.
	Ex: Open Not Contacted -> Working & Contacted -> Closed Converted -> Closed Not Converted

You dont need to create processes until theres a need
	EX: sometimes you will have leads for software development, and sometimes youll have a lead for installation

Creating a new standard object process:
	EX: lead process (for leads), sales process (for marketing), support process (for cases)

	1. setup Search -> lead/sales/support process

	2. click new 
		-it will be very basic at this step

	3. navigate to lead record type
		-this can be done at the process page using the hyperlink or
		-object manager -> the object you are building the process on -> record types

	4. create or assign the process to a record type. 
		-its best practice to name the lead record type the same as the process name

	5. updating status fields of the process
		-object manager -> object that you are building the process on -> fields and relationships -> [object] status -> picklist values
		-you can create, edit, delete, deactivate, default and reorder the process values here
——————————————————————————————————————————
Creating a new custom object process/path:

	1. setup search -> User Interface -> Path Settings
	2. enable paths
	3. create new path
	4. add this path on the lightning page 
		note: this can only be done on lightning as you will be editing the actual lightning page, not the underlying page layout
		note: be careful to choose org wide bc if you only made a process for a certain record type, and you assign it org wide, you will add this process onto other record types. You should instead use app, record type and profile.

Updating status fields of the process

	-object manager -> object that you are building the process on -> fields and relationships -> [object] status -> picklist values
	-you can create, edit, delete, deactivate, default and reorder the process values here

You can also include values that can be considered 'converted'
	EX: the client wants another value for 'converted next quarter'. You can create a new value and select it to be 'converted'
	notes: 
		-you can have multiple values that are converted
		-additional converted fields wont show in the path. They all fall under the convert field
		-When you convert, one of the fields on the bottom will ask which conversion type
		(ex:converted or converted next quarter)
