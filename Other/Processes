Processes
——————————————————————————————————————————
A process is the sequential graph at the top of the record that shows what phase the object is in.
	Ex: Open Not Contacted -> Working & Contacted -> Closed Converted -> Closed Not Converted

You dont need to create processes until theres a need
	EX: sometimes you will have leads for software development, and sometimes youll have a lead for installation

Creating a new standard object process:
	EX: lead process (for leads), sales process (for marketing), support process (for cases)

	1. setup Search -> lead/sales/support process

	2. click new 
		-it will be very basic at this step

	3. navigate to lead record type
		-this can be done at the process page using the hyperlink or
		-object manager -> the object you are building the process on -> record types

	4. create or assign the process to a record type. 
		-its best practice to name the lead record type the same as the process name

	5. updating status fields of the process
		-object manager -> object that you are building the process on -> fields and relationships -> [object] status
		-when you create new statuses, they will be at the end of the process
		-after you save, in the same place, you can  click reorder.

Creating a new custom object process/path:

	1. setup search -> User Interface -> Path Settings
	2. enable paths
	3. create new path
	4. add this path on the lightning page 
		note: this can only be done on lightning as you will be editing the actual lightning page, not the underlying page layout
		note: be careful to choose org wide bc if you only made a process for a certain record type, and you assign it org wide, you will add this process onto other record types. You should instead use app, record type and profile.
