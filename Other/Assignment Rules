Lead assignment rules to specify how leads are assigned to users or queues. 
Case assignment rules to determine how cases are assigned to users or put into queues.

Lead assignment rules can assign leads regardless of whether leads are created manually, generated from Web-to-Lead forms, or imported
Case assignment rules can assign cases regardless if they were manually or automatically using Web-to-Case, Email-to-Case, etc
