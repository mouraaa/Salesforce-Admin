Setup Search -> Feature Settings -> Marketing -> Web-to-Lead

Web-to-lead is a process you can apply to your website forms that allows marketers to automatically push form submissions on their website into their Salesforce CRM. They automatically capture visitor information and store it directly into Salesforce

Once that form is embedded onto the website, the leads will trickle into salesforce automatically anytime someone submits the form.
