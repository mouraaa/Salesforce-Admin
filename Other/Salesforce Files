Salesforce Files
——————————————————————————————————————————
Setup search -> files

You can use 'files' for your VCS (version control system) tp upload your documents. If you click the buttom arrow on the right, you can upload a new version and you can track all versions by selectinv 'view file details'

You can share these files with people inside or outside the org. You can allow people to view only or collaborate.

If multiple people are making changes at the same time and upload a new version, you will have to do a document compare and merge the changes (think github)
