Record Types
——————————————————————————————————————————
Record Types are a way of grouping many records of one type for that object. Record Types should be used for records that have the same concept, but need to be different in execution. 

Record types make life easier for the end user - only showing them what they need. They tell the user what is required for that specific record type without bothering them with fields that are irrelevant.

Record types can be applied to any standard or custom object.

Benefits:
	1. each record page can have different
		-page layouts
		-fields
		-required fields
		-picklist values
	2. reduces the number of fields on the page
	3. improves data quality (sometimes users are forced to fill out record types which can lead to poor quality)

EX: Cases can be of multiple types
		1. Suggestion
		2. Bug (If a customer needs help with a bug, I would need steps to reproduce the bug)
		2. Question
		4. Other 

Since they’re all records of the same object, you can still report on SLAs in one place

How to create record types:
	
	1. create new page layouts for each record type 
		-object manager -> the object you want to create record pages of -> page layouts
		-its always reccomended to add the 'record type' field on the page layout so when you create a record, and look at it in the future, you dont have to guess what record type it is.
		-a profile can have multiple page layouts depending on where they are in the UI 
			EX: a service cloud user can have the 'bug' page layout if hes in a bug record type or the 'question' page layout if hes in the question record type

	2. create all the custom fields you need for each record type
		-assign each field on the corresponding page layout

	3. if its a standard object (lead, case, opportunity), you must create a process 
		-see process notes for more detail

	4. create each record type 
		-object manager -> the object you want to create record types of -> record types
		-select all the profiles that can use this record type
		-assign each record type to the correct page layout you created in step 1

	5. You can then edit picklists (ie: making certain values visible/not visible)
		-navigate to the record type page (object manager -> the object you are building a process on -> record types)
		-scroll down to 'picklists' available for editing 
		-this is good for when you have the same picklists on multiple record types but want different values for each record type
