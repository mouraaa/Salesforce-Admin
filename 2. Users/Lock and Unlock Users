Lock a user:

If you cannot deactivate a user for any reason (if theyre the default workflow user, theyre seleted as part of a custom hierarchy field or if theyre on many scheduled reports and you still need to change that responsibility to someone but time of is of the essence)

You can freeze the user. They will still remain an active user but they wont be able to log in.

Resolviong Locked Users:

After a configurable number of failed password attempts, the user account will be locked.

Admin must now unlock their account by navigating to the user and clicking 'unlock'

Admin should reset their password.
