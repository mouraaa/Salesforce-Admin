Deactivating Users:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Users -> Users

If a user is tied to things such as scheduled reports or if theyre an automation user, you will have to reassign those to a new user

You cannot delete a user, you can only deactivate a user. This is for audit purposes and trail history.
