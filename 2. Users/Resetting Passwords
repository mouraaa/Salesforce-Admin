Users -> Users

You can reset the password of one or multiple users.

Before resetting a password, make sure they are actually logging in the correct place. 
	1. select the user
	2. scroll down to login history 
	3. if their login status says failure, they might be accessing the wrong url or typing in wrong username, etc

You can click an individual user, click edit, scroll down to 'generate new password and email user' and save.
