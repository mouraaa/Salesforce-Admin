Creating Custom Objects (object manager)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Objects can be standard or custom made. All objects can be found in the object manager.

To see the relationships between objects you can use the schema builder found in the object manager on the top right.

Creating a custom object:

Typically, you will select 'In Development' for the deployment status to allow you to test without other users seeing it.
Typically, youll be testing in a sandbox enviornment wheres theres not any regular users except for admins and developers so it doesnt hurt to put it in deployed status at some point

Sharing Rules

When you create a custom object, it will automatiallty grant access using role hierarchy. You can change this if you want in security -> sharing settings and it will be at the very bottom since its the last object you created

You can also now create sharing rules for that custom object in the same place
