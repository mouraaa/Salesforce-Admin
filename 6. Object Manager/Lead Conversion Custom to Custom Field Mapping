Custom to Custom Field Mapping During Lead Conversion
——————————————————————————————————————————
When a lead is converted into an account, a contact and an opportunity, all the standard fields that are on the original lead will automatically transfer over if there is an equivalent one on the account, contact and opportunity 
	EX: lead name -> contact name, etc

However, this doesnt apply for custom fields since Salesforce doesnt know if the custom fields are the same. To map custom to custom fields:
	Object Manager -> lead -> fields and relationships -> map lead fields

Now, anytime a lead is converted, mapped custom fields that exist on a lead/contact/account/opportunity will also automatiicaly transfer.
