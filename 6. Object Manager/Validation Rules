Validation Rules
——————————————————————————————————————————
Object Manager -> Validation Rules
	You can also navigate to the field in question and set a validation rule from there.

Sometimes you need to create validation rules for fields you created.
	EX: you create a percentage field with up to 3 digits left of the decimal (because 100% has 3 digits)
		however, a user can technically enter in 999%

Create a valdiation rule using formulas and enter an error message.

Note: This will not fix anything that was done before the validation rule was created.
