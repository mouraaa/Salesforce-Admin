Fields and Relationships:
——————————————————————————————————————————
When you create a custom object, the fields and relationships for that will be very limited so you will have to add any required fields 

If you are adding a new 'master-detail relationship' field, you have to use the child and create that field, not the parent

If you are asked to convert a field type to another, its always better to delete the old field and create a new field and import the old values bc
	1. changing the data type of a field can have implications for existing data (ie: data loss) 
	2. dependencies and integrations that rely on the field being modified can be impacted
	3. validation rules, workflows, or process builder flows associated with the field can be impacted

——————————————————————————————————————————
Field Validations and Dependencies:

You can create validation rules for these fields and have field dependencies
	(see the validation rules and field dependency notes for more info)

Deleting and Restoring Fiedls:

You can delete and restore fields from an object. There is a 15 day grace period once deleted where you can restore that field along with the data. You can choose to erase the field, which would skip the 15 day grace period.  

It's always recommended to run a data export before deleting a custom field by clicking the data report.

Once an object is deleted, even if restored there are certain things to note that you might want to change manually.
	1. the developer/API name will change to nameoffield_del 
	2. the field would be removed from all edited page layouts
	3. if the field was required, its no longer required
	4. the field was removed from all reports
	5. the field as remvoed from any app exchange packages that contianted it directly
