Record Page Layout:
——————————————————————————————————————————
User Interface -> Record Page Settings

By default, records are presented in grouped view but if users want more real estate, more width and less clutter, you can change the record page settings to full view.

You can also change the 'activity' tab to become 2 separate related lists of 'open activities' and 'activity history' instead of it being its own 

This is an org wide setting.
