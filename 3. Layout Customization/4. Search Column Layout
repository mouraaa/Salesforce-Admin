Search Column Layout:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Object Manager -> the object you want to edit -> search layouts 

When you search for a specific object, you can edit the search layout (columns that are shown when searching)
	EX: you want to see the account rating, account phone, account owner, etc when in list view
	
From here, you can add the columns that are displayed when you search for that object

This can be edited by profile
——————————————————————————————————————————
You can also independently select the fields to display when in an object list view to easily filter searches
	How: Click the gear icon, select 'fields to display'.
