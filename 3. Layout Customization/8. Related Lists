Customizing Related Lists:

Object Manager -> object -> page layout -> select the page layout -> related lists

Not all objects will come with related lists on the page layout to add.
	EX: custom objects wont come with the 'cases' related field

to add, do the following.

	1. object Manager -> the object you want you put on your custom object (in this case it is cases) -> fields and relationships
	2. create a lookup relationship field and relate it to the object
	3. save

after saving, you will find it on the related lists section of your object.

	4. select 'enhanced lists' from the lookup menu. This might be defaulted to 'Default'
