Global Search vs Setup Search / Quick Find:

Setup Search / Quick Find: 
	you can search for apps or items (leads, accounts, cases, etc)
	This is found on the left side of the screen

Global Search: 
	you can search for individual records and more granular items (john smith, Canon Incorporated, 00033581, etc)
	This is found at the top in the middle of the screen
	If you want to look for all instances of a term that happens behind the scenes, use global search
