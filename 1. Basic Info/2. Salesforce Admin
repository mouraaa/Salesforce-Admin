Salesforce Admin:
——————————————————————————————————————————
A Salesforce Administrator solves business problems by customizing the Salesforce Platform. They build, configure, and automate technology solutions to deliver business value. Salesforce Administrators work with stakeholders to define system requirements and customize the platform. 

Administrators create and update training materials, user guides, and documentation to support users in effectively utilizing Salesforce. They conduct training sessions or workshops to educate users on new features, best practices, and system changes.

A Salesforce Admin best understands how to make the platform work for their company’s goals. Core responsibilities include supporting users, managing data, maintaining security standards, and delivering actionable analytics. 

Admins will spend most of their time in the setup menu. This is different than what the end user will be using. End users will be using the frontend inside of an application.
