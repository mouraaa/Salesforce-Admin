Role Hierachy (Users -> Role)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Hierarchy has to do with what records users can see and do to those records, regardless of the organization-wide default settings.

Users at the top can see the records of people under them, but users at the bottom cannot see the rows owened by their higher ups.

Similarly, people at the same level cannot see each others records (with the exception of sharing rules)

You can create new roles and assign users to them here

In a real org, you should record what the hierarchy was before editing it just in case you need to go back to it.

When you create a custom object, it will automatiallty grant access using role hierarchy. You can change this if you want in security -> sharing settings and it will be at the very bottom since its the last object you created
