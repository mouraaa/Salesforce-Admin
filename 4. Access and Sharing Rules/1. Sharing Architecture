Sharing Architecture:
——————————————————————————————————————————
Salesforce starts with restrictive access and you provide wider access

1. Permission Sets (most restrictive)
2. Profile 
3. Org Wide Defaults
4. Role Hierachy (from top to bottom)
5. Sharing Rules (lateral: ie sharing people on the same level)
6. Manual Sharing (flexible, can share anywhere)
7. Team Access
8. Territory Hierarchy Access (widest access)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Profile level changes override the organization session settings.

Ideally, you should have the most strict rules as your org wide defaults and open them up based on other sharing concepts (permission sets, profiles,etc)
