Restriction Rules: 
——————————————————————————————————————————
Object Manager -> object you want to restrict -> restriction rules

You can restrict what records a user can see based on user and record criteria. This goes further than after org wide defaults, hirarchy, sharing, etc

Restriction rules are set in place to allow users to only see a specific type of record, not to take away certain types of records

Not all objects can have restriction rules. Restriction rules are available for custom objects, external objects, contracts, tasks, and events.
