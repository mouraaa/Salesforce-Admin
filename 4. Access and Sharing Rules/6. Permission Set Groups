Permission Sets vs Permission Set Groups

Overtime, you might find that you assign the same permission sets to a large group of users. Trying to remember all the permission sets that you assign to these group of users is tiresome, hence permission set groups are a group of permission sets

Ex: Creating a new permission set group called 'Support Baseline' and assigning that group permissions sets such as 'service analytic user', 'service clous user', 'delete cases' etc

Combined permissions is where you see all the combined permissions of the indivudal permission sets in the group
	EX: if you navigate to combined oermissions -> Permission Set Group Overview -> Object Permissions -> Cases, you will see all the accesses combined from the indivudal permission sets
