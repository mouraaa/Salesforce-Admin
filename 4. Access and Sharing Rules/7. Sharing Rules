Sharing Rules 
——————————————————————————————————————————
Automatic Sharing Rules: (Sharing Settings -> Sharing Rules)

Sharing rules are used to make automatic exceptions to your org wide sharing settings for some users. They are created at the object level

You can only use sharing rules to grant wider access to data, not to restrict data.

Example: You want to share accounts within the banking industry to all roles and subodinates of the 'Sales WW' role. 

The Sales WW role and their subordinates originally did not have access to that info, but now they would

Manual Sharing:

Sometimes it’s impossible to define a consistent group of users who need access to a particular set of records. 

Record owners can use manual sharing to give read and edit permissions to users who don’t have access any other way. Manual sharing isn’t automated like organization-wide sharing settings, role hierarchies, or sharing rules.

But it gives record owners the flexibility to share records with users that must see them.

Note: Manual sharing is removed when the record owner changes

Public Groups:  Users -> Public Groups

A group consists of a set of users. A group can contain individual users, other groups, or the users in a particular role or territory. It can also contain the users in a particular role or territory plus all the users below that role or territory in the hierarchy.

You can use groups in the following ways.
	-To set up default sharing access via a sharing rule		
	-To share your records with other users

Public Groups vs Permission Set Groups:

Public groups contain users while Permission Set Groups manage permission sets based on user needs.
