Profiles (Users -> Profiles)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Profiles define how users access objets and data and what they can do within the application. It controls what apps the user has access to.

Other things that profiles have access to:
	-session settings
	-password policies
	-login IP ranges 
		-users using this profile can ONLY log in from specific IP ranges. Otherwise the login is denied)
	-login hours 
		if you are still logged on after the end time, and you make a change and save after the end time, that save will NOT hit the database. You will be in read only mode if youre still logged on after end time
	-etc

Profiles can either be standard OOB or a custom profile. 
Its always preferable to assign users a custom profile as the standard ones have restrictions that cannot be changed.

Each profile has to be assigned to a user licence which also has some features enabled or disabled to it.
——————————————————————————————————————————
Note: Profile level changes override the organization session settings.
	ex: profile session settings will override the org wide session settings

You can see which users are assigned to each profile.
