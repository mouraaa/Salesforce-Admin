Org Wide Default Sharing Settings: (OWD: org wide default)
——————————————————————————————————————————
Sharing Settings -> Org Wide Defaults

Organization-wide sharing settings specify the default level of access that users have to each others’ records. 

You use organization-wide sharing settings to lock your data to the most restrictive level. Use the other record-level security and sharing tools to selectively give access to other users. 

EX: The org wide default is for users to only have access read only for opportunities but you can give object-level permissions to read and edit opportunities.

Organization-wide defaults are the only way to restrict user access to a record.

A user can perform an action (such as view, edit, or delete) on a contact or order based on whether he or she can perform that same action on the record associated with it.
	EX: if a contact is associated with the Acme account, then a user can only edit that contact if he or she can also edit the Acme account.
